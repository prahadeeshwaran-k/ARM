## 🧠 About LPC21xx Series

The **LPC21xx** family is a range of 32-bit ARM7 microcontrollers designed for real-time embedded applications. Known for their balance of performance, memory, and peripheral integration, they are widely used in:

- 🏭 Industrial automation  
- 📱 Consumer electronics  
- 🤖 Robotics  
- 📡 Communication systems  

### 🔧 Key Features

- ⚙️ **ARM7TDMI-S** 32-bit RISC core  
- 💾 Up to **256 KB Flash** and **16 KB SRAM**  
- ⚡ **Fast GPIO** with toggle support  
- 🔌 Multiple interfaces: **UART, SPI, I2C, CAN**  
- ⏱️ **Timers**, **PWM**, **RTC**, **Watchdog**  
- 📊 **10-bit ADC** (varies by model)  
- 🚀 Runs up to **60 MHz**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Requirements

- 🧱 LPC21xx Development Board (e.g., LPC2129, LPC2148)  
- 🛠 Keil µVision4 or µVision5 IDE  
- 🔃 Flash Magic (for UART flashing)  
- 🔌 USB-UART or JTAG debugger  

### 🧪 How to Use

1. 📂 Open the `.uvproj` file in Keil uVision  
2. 🧠 Write or modify code  
3. 🧰 Build and generate `.hex`  
4. 🔥 Flash using Flash Magic  
5. 👀 Observe output via LED, UART, etc.
